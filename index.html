    <p id="paragraph1"> Water is an essensial part of life, and most Canadians do not think twice about their privilege. For indigenous peoples, this is not the case; First Nations communities have been facing <a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1538160229321/1538160276874">boil water advisories </a>for over 20 years, leading to the spread of water borne illnesses and a decline in the health of the most vulrenable. Since colonization, indigenous populations have been barred from maintaining and funding their own water treatment systems, the federal government needing to take the responsibility. Shipments of bottled water are a regular occurrence, which may result in delays and overall issues for indigenous communities.

      </div>
         <p>
        As you can see, there are still many boil water advisories remaining, with the most in Ontario. This reveals a significant problem with the relocation and reorganization of assets in Ontario. Everyone should have access to clean water, and it does not stop at indigneous peoples.

     <div class="flexItem3">
      <p id="paragraph3">As of last year, more than 2/3rds of existing boil water advisories have been lifted. 1.3% are under a feasibility study to see if a new plant is possible. All these problems are arising because of the lack of responsiblity the government is taking to end these advisories. Why did they wait so long? Some advisories will be lifted in the construction phase or even the design phase, reduing the number of boil water advisories but not reducing the amount of unclean water on reserves. </p>
