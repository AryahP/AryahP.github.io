    Hello! My name is Arya, the creator of this webpage. Since learning about indigenous peoples in Grade 5 and hearing the problems many indigenous communitties on reserves face, she has felt a strong inclination to create change to help maintain standards of living in these communities. Upon learning of boil water advisories and unclean water, she believed that creating a website to spread awareness among youth would help her fulfill her goal and train her website building skills.
